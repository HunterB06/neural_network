# Simple Neural Network

This is a simple implementation of a neural network done from scratch in C++.
As an example, you have a main that actually trains the network in order for him
to be able to perform a XOR.

| A | B | A XOR B |
| - | - | ------- |
| 0 | 0 |       0 |
| 0 | 1 |       1 |
| 1 | 0 |       1 |
| 1 | 1 |       0 |

# How to

*   To build the project, simply type `make` in your command line.
*   If you want to add debug symbols, you can use the command `make debug`.
